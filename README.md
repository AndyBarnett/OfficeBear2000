Setup:
Install 'pygame' with the installer included in this repo (if you're on 64-bit Windows) or from here if you're on something else: http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml

To run:
Navigate your command line to your repo's folder before you execute it, as the script looks for the music and the images in the directory it's run from.
